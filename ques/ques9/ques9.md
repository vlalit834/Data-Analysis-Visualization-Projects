Hello developers! Welcome to Project 4: Weather & Climate Pattern Explorer! 👏🌦️

Chef loves travelling across different cities, but he never knows what weather to expect! He has collected **temperature** and **humidity** data from multiple cities over 10 days.

However, looking at a raw spreadsheet is confusing. Chef needs your help to turn this data into **meaningful climate insights**.

## Important Notes

You are given a single file: `main.py`:

- **Do NOT change function names**: The testing system relies on them.
- **Do NOT use `plt.show()`**: This project runs in a "headless" environment (no screen). You must use `plt.savefig("filename.png")` to generate output.
- **Do NOT close the plot after saving**: Do not call `plt.close()` or similar functions after saving the plot.
- All functions are already defined in `main.py`. You need to complete the missing logic.

## Dataset

You will work with `weather.csv`. This dataset contains weather observations recorded over **10 days** from **3 distinct Indian cities** (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore).

It contains the following columns:

- `city`: Name of the city (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore).
- `day`: Day number (1 to 10).
- `temperature`: Average daily temperature in Celsius.
- `humidity`: Average daily humidity percentage.

## Your Tasks

1. Load Weather Data

Inside `load_weather_data()`:

- Read the dataset (`weather.csv`) using Pandas library.
- Print the first 5 rows to ensure it is loaded correctly.

Docs: `pd.read_csv()` | `df.head()`

2. Plot Temperature vs. Humidity (Scatter Plot)

Inside `plot_temperature_vs_humidity(df)`:

We want to see if there is a correlation between heat and humidity.

- **Function**: We want you to use the **figure-level function** for this, like `sns.relplot()` (Relational Plot).
- **Mappings:**
  - x: `temperature`
  - y: `humidity`
  - Color the points based on the city (Explore the `hue` parameter).
  - This plot should be of `scatter` kind.

- **Styling:**
  - Title: As we used the figure-level function, we have to add a "Super Title" (`Temperature vs Humidity`) using `g.fig.suptitle()` function.
  - Position: Use `y=1.02` to push the title slightly up.
  - Save: Save as `temp_vs_humid_scatter.png`.
    - Use `bbox_inches` parameter to avoid cutting off title (set to `'tight'`).

Docs: `sns.relplot()` | `plt.savefig()` | `Figure.suptitle()`

3. Plot Temperature Distribution (KDE Curve)

Inside `plot_temperature_kde(df)`:

A KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) is like a smooth histogram. It shows us the "shape" of the temperature data.

- **Function**: We want you to use the **axes-level function** for this, like `sns.kdeplot()`.
- **Mappings:**
  - X: `temperature`
  - Draw a separate curve for each city (Explore the `hue` parameter).
  - Shade the area under the curve (Explore the `fill` parameter).

- **Styling:**
  - Set figure size to 10 inches by 6 inches.
  - Add Title: `"Temperature Distribution (KDE)"`.
  - Add Grid: Add a grid with transparency set to `0.3` (Explore the `alpha` parameter).
  - Save the plot as `temperature_kde.png`.

Docs: `sns.kdeplot()` | `plt.figure()` | `plt.title()` | `plt.grid()`

4. Faceted Plot by City

Inside `plot_faceted_distribution(df)`:

Sometimes, plotting everything on one chart is messy. **Faceting** splits the data into separate charts.

- **Function**: We want you to use the **figure-level function** for this, like `sns.displot()` (Distribution Plot).
- **Mappings:**
  - x: `temperature`
  - Faceting: Create a separate chart for each city (Explore the `col` parameter).
  - Set the kind of plot to `"kde"`.
  - Shade the area under the curve (Explore the `fill` parameter).

- **Styling:**
  - Title: As we used the figure-level function, we have to add a "Super Title" (`Faceted Temperature Distributions`) using `g.fig.suptitle()` function.
  - Position: Use `y=1.03` to push the title slightly up.
  - Save: Save as `temperature_facets.png`.
    - Use `bbox_inches` parameter to avoid cutting off title (set to `'tight'`).

Docs: `sns.displot()` | `Figure.suptitle()` | `plt.savefig()`

## Expected Output:

When you run the code, your program should print the following messages and generate three image files in the same directory:

### 1. Console Output:
